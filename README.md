# Portfolio Android App (Login/Registration Demo)

An **Android (Java)** demo app that implements a simple **registration + login** flow and shows a basic “home” screen with stored user details.

> This is a learning/portfolio project.

## Tech stack

- Android (Java)
- Gradle
- Networking: **Volley**

## Backend/API

This app references hosted endpoints (000webhost) in the source code. If those endpoints are down, you’ll need to replace them with your own backend.

## Run locally

1. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
2. Let Gradle sync.
3. Run on an emulator or physical device.

## Key files

- `app/src/main/java/com/parth/portfolio/` — activities + session management
- `app/src/main/res/layout/` — UI layouts

## Notes

- `Portfolio.zip` is included; the working Android project lives in the `app/` module.
